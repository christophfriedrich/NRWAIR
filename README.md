# NRWAIR

read: "unaware" -- because you're unaware of what particles are in the air! ;-)

This webapp combines Esri Basemaps (via WMTS) with air quality data from the Umweltbundesamt (via SOS, self-hosted). These are the files to put into the /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT/ folder of the 52° North SOS server implementation.

Written as a project for the Spatial Information Infrastructures (SII) course during by B.Sc. Geoinformatics studies at Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi) of Münster University (WWU).
